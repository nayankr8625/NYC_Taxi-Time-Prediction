# NYC_Taxi-Time-Prediction

Our model's goal is to accurately forecast the time it will take a taxi to travel between one pickup location and another drop-off location. In the hurried, time-constrained world of today, everyone wants to know how long it will take to get where they're going so they can move their plans along. Therefore, we already have billion-dollar startups like Uber and Ola where we can track the duration of our trips for their peace of mind. As a result, we suggested a method by which each taxi service provider could provide precise trip duration to their customers while taking into account variables like traffic, time, and day of pickup.
We suggest a technique for predicting trip duration in which we combine several algorithms, fine-tune the corresponding algorithmic parameters by comparing each parameter to the RMSE, and then predict the trip duration. We used a variety of models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, to make our prediction. In order to handle missing data, eliminate duplication, and resolve data conflicts, we also examined a number of data mining techniques.
